# FoodRun - the game about running food.
**Have you ever wondered, what is it like to be a Sisyphus?**

No? Well, then consider this project just another rubbish piece of gamedev.

But for thoose, that can see, absorb and enjoy
true art, this is a **masterpiece**!

***FoodRun is a simulator of infinite despair and suffering.*** Put yourselves in Sisyphus's shoes(sandals) and try to reach that cherished grape. To motivate you to act, we added
an artificial opponent! He is also starving, so the competition is up. To equal the chances, the grape was also equipped with a teleportation device, so good luck reaching it! Additionally, if you do have friends, you can compete for the food together in A Multiplayer Mode!

## Features:
1. Yes, this is a windows console app! And yes, it's ASCII graphics.

2. Two playing modes available: Singleplayer and Multiplayer

    2.1 Singleplayer: Choose the difficulty of your artificial opponent and try to beat him in an eternal chase! Pay for your sins!

    2.2 Multiplayer: Convince other sinners to enter the arena and become the quickest and most ambitious mortal!

3. Dive into ***eternal suffering*** with only one way to leave - **Closing the App.**

## Why should I play this nonsense instead of an AAA Game?
