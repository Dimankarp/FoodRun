But for thoose, that can see, absorb and enjoy
true art, this is a masterpiece!

***FoodRun is a simulator of infinite despair and suffering.*** Put yourselves in Sisyphus's shoes(sandals) and try to reach that cherished grape. To motivate you to act, we added
an artificial opponent! He is also starving, so the competition is up. To equal the chances, the grape was also equipped with a teleportation device, so good luck reaching it!

## Features:
1. Yes, this is a windows console app! And yes, it's ASCII graphics.

2. Two playing modes available: Singleplayer and Multiplayer(WIP)

## Why should I play that nonsense instead of an AAA Game?
